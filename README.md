# Gesture-Based-Virtual-Keyboard
An intelligent virtual keyboard controlled by hand gestures with real-time text prediction and MongoDB data logging capabilities
An intelligent virtual keyboard controlled by hand gestures with real-time text prediction and MongoDB data logging capabilities.
üéØ Overview
This project implements a contactless virtual keyboard that recognizes hand gestures using computer vision and provides intelligent text predictions powered by AI. Users can type by hovering their index finger over virtual keys displayed on screen, with automatic word completion and comprehensive data logging for analysis.
‚ú® Key Features

Gesture Recognition: Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
AI Text Prediction: Intelligent next-word prediction using DistilGPT-2
Contactless Typing: Hover-based key selection (1-second threshold)
Data Persistence: MongoDB integration for storing typed text and predictions
Adaptive Layout: Responsive keyboard layout that adjusts to window size
Visual Feedback: Real-time hand landmark visualization and key highlighting

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
Core Components

Computer Vision: MediaPipe Hands for gesture detection
AI/ML: Hugging Face Transformers (DistilGPT-2) for text generation
Database: MongoDB for data logging and analytics
UI: OpenCV for real-time video processing and keyboard rendering

Workflow

Gesture Capture: Camera captures hand movements
Hand Tracking: MediaPipe identifies finger positions
Key Detection: System maps fingertip position to keyboard layout
Selection Logic: 1-second hover triggers key press
Text Prediction: AI suggests next word on ENTER press
Data Logging: All interactions saved to MongoDB

üéÆ How to Use
Basic Operation

Launch: Run the Python script to start the camera feed
Position: Place your hand in front of the camera
Navigate: Move your index finger over virtual keys
Select: Hover over a key for 1 second to "press" it
Type: Continue selecting keys to form words
Predict: Press ENTER to get AI-powered word suggestions
Exit: Press 'q' to quit the application

Keyboard Layout
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
Q W E R T Y U I O P
A S D F G H J K L
Z X C V B N M
SPACE  BS  ENTER
Special Keys

SPACE: Add space between words
BS: Backspace (delete last character)
ENTER: Trigger AI text prediction for next word

Visual Indicators

Green Circle: Your fingertip position
Green Key: Currently hovered key
Blue Text: AI prediction display
Hand Skeleton: MediaPipe hand landmarks

üìä Data Analytics
The system automatically logs all interactions to MongoDB:
json{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "text": "Hello world",
  "timestamp": 1672531200.0,
  "predicted_word": "today"
}
Accessing Data
pythonfrom pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')
db = client['gesture_keyboard_db']
collection = db['typed_text']

# Get all typed text
all_data = list(collection.find())
‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Adjustable Parameters
python# Gesture detection sensitivity
min_detection_confidence = 0.7
min_tracking_confidence = 0.7

# Selection timing
selection_threshold = 1.0  # seconds

# Key dimensions
KEY_WIDTH = 60
KEY_HEIGHT = 60
H_PADDING = 10
V_PADDING = 15
AI Model Configuration
python# Change prediction model
predictor = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")  # Larger model
predictor = pipeline("text-generation", model="distilbert-base-uncased")  # Different architecture
üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Camera not detected:
python# Try different camera indices
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # Instead of 0
MongoDB connection error:
python# Check if MongoDB is running
sudo systemctl status mongodb
Hand tracking issues:

Ensure good lighting
Keep hand clearly visible
Avoid background clutter
Maintain steady hand position

Performance optimization:
python# Reduce frame processing load
hands = mp_hands.Hands(
    max_num_hands=1,
    min_detection_confidence=0.5,  # Lower for better performance
    min_tracking_confidence=0.5
)
